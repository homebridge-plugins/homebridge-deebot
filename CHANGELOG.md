# Change Log

All notable changes to homebridge-deebot will be documented in this file.

This project tries to adhere to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). In practice, this means that the version number will be incremented based on the following:

- `MAJOR` version when a minimum supported version of `homebridge` or `node` is increased to a new major version, or when a breaking change is made to the plugin config
- `MINOR` version when a new device type is added, or when a new feature is added that is backwards-compatible
- `PATCH` version when backwards-compatible bug fixes are implemented
